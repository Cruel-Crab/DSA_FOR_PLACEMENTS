# DAY-1 Introduction to Programming & Flowcharts

#### How to look at a problem:-
1) Understand the question, what is asked to do ?
2) Collect all the given values/data present in the statement
3) Think of the approach that can be used to solve the problem
4) Try writing out the code of it

#### Flowcharts:-

They are the diagrammatic/graphical way of representing an algorithm.
It is generally used as a planning tool to solve the given problem.

Flowchart statement solved:-
 * Sum of two numbers 
 * Calculate Simple Interest
 * Find average of three numbers
 * Check if a is smaller than b - if true print "Yes" else "No"
 * Check if given number is odd or even
 * Check if given number is +ve, -ve or 0
 * Check if given triangle is valid or not
 * Print all numbers from 1 to n
 * Print all even numbers from 1 to n
 * Print all odd numbers from 1 to n (both inclusive)
 * Find sum of all numbers from 1 to n
 * Find factorial of number
 * Check if given number is prime or not
